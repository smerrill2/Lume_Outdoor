    overview: "Sam's 2016 brick home on City View Street used to disappear once the sun went down. The entryway was pitch-black, the walkway felt sketchy, and those rich red bricks‚Äîone of the house's best features‚Äîwere completely lost at night.",
    challenge: "The main challenge was transforming a completely dark property into a welcoming, safe environment while showcasing the home's beautiful brick architecture that was invisible after sunset.",
    approach: "We designed a simple but powerful plan: four warm-white uplights to make the brick pop, four path lights to guide every step to the door, and two discreet tree spots to frame the whole scene from the street.",

    results: "Installation took just one day‚Äîtrenches cut, cables buried, lawn restored so neatly you'd never know we'd been there. As dusk fell, we walked the property with Sam, nudging beam angles until every brick line and flower bed landed in perfect, 2700K light. When the neighborhood lights came on, her house stole the show.",

    overview: "This stunning modern ranch home in Wichita showcased clean lines and expansive glass windows that called for sophisticated lighting design. The homeowners wanted to enhance their property's contemporary aesthetic while ensuring practical illumination for their large lot.",
    challenge: "The property's sprawling layout and modern architecture required a delicate balance between dramatic accent lighting and functional security lighting. The challenge was to create visual interest across the large facade without over-illuminating the interior through the expansive windows.",

With teenage kids coming home late from activities and frequent dinner parties, they needed both safety and style.",
    challenge: "The main challenge was creating enough light for safety while respecting the quiet elegance of this established neighborhood. The Millers wanted their home to feel welcoming, not like a commercial property. Drake immediately recognized the need to highlight the home's classic lines while Talan focused on the practical aspects of driveway safety.",
    approach: "We designed a subtle yet effective lighting plan that would make the Millers feel proud every time they pulled into their driveway.
